# Project Euler's solutins

All the projects are done in python 

# Caution
*Do not read* the project if you are trying on your own as cautioned on the project's website.
I have put it here for the purpose of reference as my needs may require.

Saw  this on this blog post on [medium](https://blog.usejournal.com/consider-yourself-a-developer-you-should-solve-the-project-euler-problems-ed8d13397c9c)

    (NB: multiple comments have mentioned that sharing your Project Euler solutions is against the competition’s rules. If you’re competing on current Project Euler challenges, join the official forum and discuss code there.
    However, for the archived problems that have been solved hundreds of thousands of times, there’s a lot to gain from adding Project Euler code to your portfolio, like hundreds of other developers have before you.
    Just make sure you don’t look at other people’s solutions when developing your own! That spoils the fun and means you won’t learn as much!)
